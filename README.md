* you cannot run this file locally because I hide my `settings.py` with `.gitignore`, in order to hide django key.
* I know I don't need to if I use private repository(or use `secrets.json`),
* but to share the code with you, I think it is the best way.
* If you need `settings.py`, contact me through choyoung7789@gmail.com
* Still, you can run this app on my demo host, and you can see my all code through github.
